            <h4>1. What are aliens?</h4>
            <h5>Aliens, also referred to as extraterrestrial <br/> beings or ETs, are hypothetical or <br/>theoretical life forms that <br/>originate from a planet other than Earth.</h5>
           <h4> 2. Do aliens exist?</h4>
            <h5>The existence of aliens has not been conclusively proven. <br/>While some scientists argue that the vastness of the universe<br/> suggests the likelihood of extraterrestrial life, there is<br/> currently no direct evidence confirming their existence.</h5>
            <h4>3. Have aliens visited Earth?</h4>
            <h5>There is no scientifically accepted evidence<br/> that aliens have visited Earth. Reports of<br/> UFO sightings and alleged encounters with <br/>extraterrestrial beings are largely anecdotal <br/>and not substantiated by empirical evidence.</h5>

            <h4>4. What do aliens look like?</h4>
            <h5>The appearance of aliens in popular culture varies <br/>widely, ranging from humanoid to radically different<br/> forms. Speculations include beings with large eyes, <br/>elongated limbs, and different numbers of appendages,<br/> but these are purely speculative.</h5>
            <h4>5. Could aliens be more advanced than humans?</h4>
            <h5>It is possible that alien civilizations could be <br/>more advanced than humans, given the potential for<br/> civilizations to evolve over billions of years.<br/> However, this is purely speculative without concrete<br/> evidence of their existence.</h5>

        <div class="more_text"><p>In 1962 comic There are Martians Among Us, from Amazing Fantasy #15, illustrates the way fear of extraterrestrials could reflect Cold War anxieties. In the comic, a search party gathers around a landed alien craft, but it can find no sign of alien beings. Radio announcers warn those nearby to stay indoors. The action shifts to a husband and wife as he prepares to leave their home despite a television announcer's warning to remain indoors. As he waves goodbye he reminds his wife to stay inside. The wife however decides to slip out to the store and is attacked and dragged off. The husband returns home and finding it empty runs towards the telephone in a panic. In a twist, the anxious husband reveals that he and his wife are the Martians.
            The fear that there might be alien enemies in our midst resonates with fears of Soviets and communists from the McCarthy era. Ultimately, in this story, the humans are the ones who accost and capture the alien woman. The shift in perspective puts the humans in the position of the monsters.</p></div>
